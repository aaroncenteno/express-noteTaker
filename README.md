# Express.js Note Taker

## Description

The Project of the week was to connect the frontend of an application to a created back end code. The Note Taker application had given front end code that contaitned HTML, CSS and JS. The task of the challenge was to write back end code that connected these two via routes. The notes also had to be written and stored in an API that could be called on at any time using the application. Back end coding has proven to be a new challenge.
